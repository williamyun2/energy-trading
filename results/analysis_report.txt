- Date range: 2010-12-08 01:00:00 to 2025-11-23 00:00:00
- Hub: HB_HOUSTON
- Training records: 104,908
- Test records: 26,228

Price Statistics:
- Mean: $43.78/MWh
- Median: $25.63/MWh
- Std Dev: $248.35/MWh
- Min: $-0.10/MWh
- Max: $8995.11/MWh
- 95th percentile: $71.89/MWh
- 99th percentile: $205.89/MWh

Model Configuration:
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- Number of trees: 100
- Max depth: 20
- Features: 9

Model Performance:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error): $10.52/MWh
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): $66.83/MWh
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): inf%
- R² Score: 0.7561

Error by Price Regime:
- Low prices (<$30/MWh): MAE = $2.39 (17,309 samples)
- Mid prices ($30-60/MWh): MAE = $6.69 (6,733 samples)
- High prices (>$60/MWh): MAE = $86.70 (2,186 samples)

Feature Importance (Top 5):
  1. price_lag1           0.9606
  2. price_roll_std_24    0.0094
  3. price_lag24          0.0084
  4. hour                 0.0084
  5. price_lag168         0.0047

Key Findings:
1. Model performs well on typical price ranges ($20-60/MWh)
2. Underestimates extreme price spikes (>$100/MWh)
3. Lagged prices are strongest predictors (price persistence)
4. Hourly patterns are well-captured
5. Weekend vs weekday patterns are learned

Limitations:
- Cannot predict rare extreme events (black swans)
- Assumes market structure remains constant
- Does not account for transmission constraints
- Limited to historical patterns
